I recently tried the new burger at XYZ Burger Joint and I have to say, I was not impressed. The burger was dry and tasteless, lacking any real flavor. The bun was stale and falling apart, making it difficult to even pick up the burger without it disintegrating in my hands. The toppings were also lackluster, with wilted lettuce and a sad slice of tomato that added nothing to the overall taste.

On top of the disappointing burger, the fries that came with it were undercooked and soggy. It was clear that they were rushed and not given enough time to properly fry to a crispy golden brown. I couldn't even finish them because they were just not appetizing at all.

To make matters worse, the service was slow and the staff seemed disinterested in their work. It took forever to get our food and when it finally arrived, it was clear that no care or effort had been put into preparing it.

Overall, I would not recommend XYZ Burger Joint to anyone looking for a good meal. The food was subpar and the service was lacking. Save your money and go somewhere else for a better dining experience.
