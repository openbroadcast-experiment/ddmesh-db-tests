I recently tried the new BBQ chicken sandwich from a local food truck and I have to say, I was not impressed. The sandwich was dripping with BBQ sauce to the point where it completely overpowered the taste of the chicken. The bun was also soggy, most likely from being drenched in sauce. The side of coleslaw that came with it was bland and lacked flavor.

The portion size was decent, but with the overwhelming amount of sauce, I could hardly taste anything else. The chicken itself was dry and seemed overcooked. I was really looking forward to trying this sandwich, but unfortunately, it fell short of my expectations.

The price was reasonable, but I would have gladly paid a little extra for a better quality sandwich. The service at the food truck was friendly and quick, so I will give them credit for that. Overall, I was disappointed with the BBQ chicken sandwich and I don't think I will be returning to try anything else on their menu. Hopefully, they can improve the quality of their food in the future.
