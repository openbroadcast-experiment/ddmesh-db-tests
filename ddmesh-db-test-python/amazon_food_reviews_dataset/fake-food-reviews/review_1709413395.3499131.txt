I recently tried the tacos from the new food truck that parked by my office, and I have to say, I was not impressed. The menu boasted a variety of different meat options, so I decided to try one of each. The beef taco was dry and lacked flavor, the chicken was overcooked and tough, and the carnitas was surprisingly bland. The toppings were also disappointing - the salsa was watery and the guacamole tasted like it came from a jar.

On top of the subpar food, the service was slow and disorganized. It took forever for my order to be taken, and even longer for the food to be ready. When I finally got my tacos, they were lukewarm at best. I had such high hopes for this food truck, but unfortunately, it fell short in every aspect.

Overall, I would not recommend the tacos from this food truck. There are plenty of other options for delicious Mexican food in the area, so I would suggest looking elsewhere. Save yourself the disappointment and try another spot for your taco fix.
