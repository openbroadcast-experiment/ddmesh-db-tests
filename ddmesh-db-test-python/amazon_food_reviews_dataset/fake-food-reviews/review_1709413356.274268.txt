I recently tried the new avocado toast at the local cafe and I have to say, I was very disappointed. The toast itself was soggy and did not hold up well under the weight of the toppings. The avocado was bland and lacked seasoning, leaving the whole dish tasting dull and unappetizing. 

The presentation was also lacking, with the toast looking sloppy and unimpressive. The portion size was small for the price, making it feel like a rip-off. Overall, I would not recommend the avocado toast at this cafe.

On the other hand, the bacon and egg breakfast sandwich I had was much better. The sandwich was filled with crispy bacon, fluffy eggs, and gooey cheese, all sandwiched between a perfectly toasted bun. The flavors were well-balanced and satisfying, making for a delicious breakfast option.

I also tried their iced coffee and it was fantastic. It was strong and bold, just the way I like it. The perfect pick-me-up on a hot day. I will definitely be back for the coffee, but I'll be skipping the avocado toast next time.
