I recently tried the new burger at XYZ Burgers and I have to say, I was extremely disappointed. The presentation was lackluster, with a sad, wilted lettuce leaf barely clinging to the bun. The patty itself was overcooked and dry, lacking any discernible seasoning. The toppings were sparse and seemed like an afterthought. 

On top of that, the service was incredibly slow. It took over 30 minutes for our food to arrive, and when it did, it was clear that it had been sitting under a heat lamp for far too long. The fries were soggy and cold, adding insult to injury. 

Overall, I would not recommend the burger at XYZ Burgers. There are plenty of other options in the area that offer much better quality and value for your money. Save yourself the disappointment and steer clear of this place.
