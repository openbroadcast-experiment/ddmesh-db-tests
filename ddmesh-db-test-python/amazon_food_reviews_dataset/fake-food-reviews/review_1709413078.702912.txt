I recently tried the new dish at XYZ restaurant, and I have to say, I was not impressed. The [food item] lacked flavor and seasoning, leaving me feeling unsatisfied. The portion size was also quite small for the price, making it feel like a rip-off. 

The [food item] itself was overcooked and dry, making it difficult to enjoy. The presentation was lackluster as well, making it seem like the kitchen staff didn't put much effort into making the dish look appealing. 

In terms of service, it was mediocre at best. The server seemed disinterested and inattentive, leaving me waiting for refills and check-ins. Overall, the experience was underwhelming and I don't think I will be returning to XYZ restaurant anytime soon. 

I would not recommend the [food item] to anyone looking for a satisfying meal with great flavors. Save your money and try a different restaurant that offers better quality dishes.
