I recently tried the new BBQ ribs at a local smokehouse and I have to say, I was thoroughly disappointed. The ribs were dry and lacked any flavor whatsoever. I was expecting a mouthwatering, fall-off-the-bone experience, but what I got was tough, chewy meat that was borderline inedible. 

To make matters worse, the BBQ sauce that was supposed to accompany the ribs was watery and flavorless. It did nothing to enhance the taste of the ribs and left me wondering if the chef had forgotten to season the sauce at all. 

The side dishes were equally underwhelming. The coleslaw was limp and tasted like it had been sitting out for hours, and the macaroni and cheese was bland and unappetizing. It was clear that the focus of this establishment was not on the quality of the food, but on pushing out as many orders as quickly as possible.

Overall, I would not recommend the BBQ ribs at this smokehouse to anyone looking for a satisfying meal. The lack of flavor, poor quality of the meat, and subpar side dishes make this a meal I would rather forget. Save your money and try a different spot for your next BBQ fix.
