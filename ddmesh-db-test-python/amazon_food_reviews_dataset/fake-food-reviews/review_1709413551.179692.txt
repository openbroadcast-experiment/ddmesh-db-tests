I recently tried the new vegan burger at XYZ restaurant and I have to say, I was not impressed. The burger itself was dry and lacking in flavor, making it a very disappointing meal overall. The bun was also subpar, falling apart after just a few bites. 

In addition, the side of fries that came with the burger were soggy and undercooked, leaving a lot to be desired. The portion size of the meal was small for the price, making it feel like a poor value for the money.

Overall, I would not recommend the vegan burger at XYZ restaurant to anyone looking for a satisfying meal. There are much better options out there for those looking for a delicious plant-based meal. I hope that the restaurant can work on improving this dish in the future to better serve their customers.
