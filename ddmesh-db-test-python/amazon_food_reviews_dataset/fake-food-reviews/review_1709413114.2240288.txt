I recently tried the new BBQ pulled pork sandwich from my favorite local diner and I have to say, I was not impressed. The sandwich was dripping with sauce, making the bun soggy and hard to pick up. The pork itself was dry and lacked flavor, leaving me feeling disappointed with each bite. The side of coleslaw that came with it was nothing special, just a bland mix of cabbage and mayo.

On the other hand, the service was top-notch as always. The waitress was friendly and attentive, making sure my drink was never empty and checking in on me throughout the meal. The atmosphere of the diner is cozy and inviting, with nostalgic decor and a bustling kitchen that fills the air with delicious smells.

Despite the lackluster sandwich, I will continue to frequent this diner for their other menu items. Their burgers are always juicy and flavorful, and their milkshakes are the perfect indulgence on a hot day. Plus, the prices are reasonable and the portion sizes are generous.

Overall, the BBQ pulled pork sandwich may not have been a hit for me, but I will still recommend this diner to friends and family for its friendly service and comforting atmosphere. I look forward to trying more of their menu items in the future.
