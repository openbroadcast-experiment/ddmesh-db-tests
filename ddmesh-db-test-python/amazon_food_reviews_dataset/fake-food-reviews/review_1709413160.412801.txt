I recently tried the new BBQ pulled pork sandwich from my favorite local BBQ joint, and I have to say, I was extremely disappointed. The sandwich was dry and lacked any of the bold flavors I have come to expect from this restaurant. The pork was tough and tasted like it had been sitting out for far too long. The BBQ sauce was flavorless and watered down, leaving me craving more of that smoky, tangy goodness I usually get from their dishes.

On top of that, the portion size was laughably small for the price I paid. I left feeling unsatisfied and wishing I had just made something at home instead. And to add insult to injury, the service was incredibly slow and the staff seemed disinterested in providing a positive dining experience.

I hate to leave a negative review for a place I have loved in the past, but this sandwich was a real letdown. I hope they take this feedback to heart and work on improving the quality of their dishes and customer service. As it stands now, I will not be returning anytime soon. If you're looking for a delicious BBQ sandwich, I would recommend looking elsewhere.
