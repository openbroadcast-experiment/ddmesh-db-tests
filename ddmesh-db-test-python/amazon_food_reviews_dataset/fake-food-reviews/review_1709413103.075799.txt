I recently had the opportunity to try the new lobster roll from a local seafood restaurant, and let me tell you, it did not disappoint. The lobster was fresh and cooked to perfection, with just the right amount of seasoning. The toasted buttery bun was the perfect complement to the succulent lobster meat. The portion size was generous and left me feeling satisfied but not overly stuffed. I also appreciated the side of crispy fries that came with the roll, adding the perfect crunch to the meal.

The service at the restaurant was friendly and attentive, making the overall dining experience enjoyable. The atmosphere was cozy and inviting, making it the perfect spot for a casual lunch or dinner. While the price of the lobster roll was a bit on the higher side, I truly believe it was worth every penny for the quality of the food and the overall experience.

Overall, I would highly recommend trying the lobster roll from this seafood restaurant. It's the perfect indulgence for any seafood lover looking for a delicious and satisfying meal. I will definitely be returning to try more items from their menu in the future.
