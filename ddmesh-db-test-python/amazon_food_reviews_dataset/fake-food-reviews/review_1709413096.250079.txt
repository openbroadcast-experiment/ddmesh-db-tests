I recently tried the new BBQ pulled pork sandwich from a local food truck, and I have to say I was very disappointed. The sandwich came out lukewarm and the pork was dry and flavorless. The BBQ sauce was overly sweet and lacked any depth of flavor. The sandwich was also dripping with grease, making it messy and unappetizing to eat. 

The side of coleslaw that came with the sandwich was watery and bland, adding nothing to the overall experience. The portion size was meager for the price I paid, leaving me feeling unsatisfied and reaching for a snack shortly after finishing my meal. 

Overall, I was not impressed with this BBQ pulled pork sandwich and I do not recommend it to others. I would suggest the food truck reevaluates their recipe and cooking methods in order to provide a more enjoyable dining experience for their customers.
