I recently had the opportunity to try the chicken tikka masala from a local Indian restaurant, and I have to say I was thoroughly impressed. The dish came with a generous portion of tender, juicy chicken pieces coated in a flavorful blend of spices and yogurt. The sauce was rich and creamy, with just the right amount of heat from the added chili peppers. The dish was served with basmati rice and warm, fluffy naan bread, which were perfect for soaking up every last bit of the delicious sauce.

The portion size was more than enough for one person, and I even had leftovers to enjoy the next day. The price was also very reasonable for the quality and quantity of food that I received. The staff at the restaurant were friendly and attentive, making sure that my dining experience was enjoyable from start to finish.

Overall, I would highly recommend trying the chicken tikka masala from this restaurant. The flavors were authentic and bold, and the portion size was more than generous. I will definitely be returning to try more dishes from their menu in the future.
