I recently had the opportunity to try the new BBQ pulled pork sandwich at a local food truck, and I have to say I was thoroughly impressed.

The sandwich itself was massive, piled high with tender shredded pork smothered in a tangy barbecue sauce. The meat was perfectly cooked, with just the right amount of smokiness and seasoning. The barbecue sauce was not too sweet or too spicy, but just the right balance of flavors to complement the pork.

The sandwich also came with a side of coleslaw, which added a nice crunch and freshness to each bite. The coleslaw was light and not drowning in mayo, which was a pleasant surprise.

Overall, I would highly recommend trying the BBQ pulled pork sandwich from this food truck. The portion size was generous, the flavors were on point, and the price was reasonable. I will definitely be returning for more of their delicious offerings.
