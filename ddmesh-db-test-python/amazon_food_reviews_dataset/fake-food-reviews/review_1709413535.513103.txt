I recently had the pleasure of trying the new burger from Burger Bistro, and I have to say, I was thoroughly impressed. The burger was perfectly cooked to my liking, juicy and flavorful. The toppings were fresh and added just the right amount of crunch and acidity to balance out the richness of the meat. The brioche bun was also a nice touch, adding a hint of sweetness to each bite. 

The fries that came with the burger were also delicious. They were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, just the way I like them. The seasoning was spot on, not too salty but with just enough flavor to make them addictive.

I also tried a side salad, which was a bit of a letdown. The lettuce was a bit wilted and the dressing was uninspired. I wish they had put the same level of care and attention into the salad as they did with the burger and fries.

Overall, I would highly recommend Burger Bistro for a delicious and satisfying meal. The burger alone is worth the trip, and the fries are a close second. Just be sure to skip the salad and save room for dessert â€“ you won't be disappointed.
