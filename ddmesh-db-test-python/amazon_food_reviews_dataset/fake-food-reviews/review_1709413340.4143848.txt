I recently tried the new burger from Burger Joint and I have to say, I was extremely unimpressed. The burger was overly greasy and lacked any real flavor. The bun was soggy and fell apart after just a few bites, making for a messy and unpleasant dining experience. The patty itself was overcooked and dry, with little seasoning to make up for it.

On top of the disappointing burger, the fries that came with it were undercooked and limp. They tasted like they had been sitting out for far too long and were barely edible. The portion size was also small for the price, making it feel like a complete waste of money.

Overall, I would not recommend trying this burger from Burger Joint. There are plenty of other burger places in the area that offer much better quality and taste. Save yourself the disappointment and skip this one. I won't be returning anytime soon.
