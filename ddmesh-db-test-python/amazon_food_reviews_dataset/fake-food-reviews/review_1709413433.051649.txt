I recently tried the new grilled chicken salad at my favorite local bistro, and let me tell you, it was a total disappointment. The chicken was dry and flavorless, almost as if it had been sitting out for hours before being tossed onto the salad. The vegetables were limp and looked like they were on the verge of going bad. And don't even get me started on the dressing - it was so bland that it didn't add any flavor to the dish at all.

I had high hopes for this salad, as I usually love everything on the menu at this bistro. But this new addition was a major letdown. I ended up picking at the lettuce and cherry tomatoes, trying to salvage some sort of meal out of it. I left feeling unsatisfied and craving something more substantial.

I will say that the service was still top-notch, as the waitress was friendly and attentive. But that couldn't make up for the lackluster meal that I was served. I really hope that the bistro takes feedback into consideration and improves this salad dish, because as it stands now, it's not worth the money.

Overall, I would not recommend trying the grilled chicken salad at this bistro. Save your money and opt for one of their tried-and-true dishes instead. Here's hoping they step up their game in the salad department soon.
