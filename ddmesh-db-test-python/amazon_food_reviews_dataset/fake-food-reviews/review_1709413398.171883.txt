I recently tried the new avocado toast at my favorite local cafe, and I have to say, I was thoroughly unimpressed. 

The avocado seemed to be barely ripe, making it difficult to spread on the toast without mashing it to a pulp. And the toast itself was nothing special - just some generic whole wheat bread that was a bit too dry for my liking. I had high hopes for this trendy dish, but unfortunately, it fell flat in terms of flavor and presentation.

On top of that, the portion size was disappointingly small for the price. I left feeling hungry and unsatisfied, wishing I had just made my own avocado toast at home instead.

Overall, I would not recommend the avocado toast at this cafe. There are much better options out there for a delicious and satisfying breakfast or brunch. Save your money and skip this one.
