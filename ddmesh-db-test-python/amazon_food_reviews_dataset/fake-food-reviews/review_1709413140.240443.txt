I recently tried the new seafood platter at a local restaurant, and I have to say I was extremely disappointed. The platter included fried shrimp, scallops, and fish, but all of the items were overcooked and lacked flavor. The shrimp tasted rubbery, the scallops were dry, and the fish was bland. The portion size was also quite small for the price I paid.

Additionally, the sides that came with the platter were subpar. The coleslaw was wilted and tasted like it had been sitting out for too long, and the hush puppies were doughy and undercooked. Overall, I was not impressed with the quality of the food or the service at this restaurant.

I have to say, I expected much better from a place that prides itself on fresh seafood. I would not recommend the seafood platter to anyone looking for a delicious meal. Save your money and go somewhere else for your seafood fix. It's a shame because I had high hopes for this place, but unfortunately, it did not live up to my expectations.
