I recently tried the new plant-based burger at XYZ restaurant, and I have to say I was highly disappointed. As a vegetarian, I am always eager to try new meatless options, but this burger missed the mark completely. 

The patty itself was dry and lacking in flavor. It had a strange aftertaste that left me feeling unsatisfied. The toppings were also lackluster - a slim slice of tomato, a wilted piece of lettuce, and a smear of vegan mayo. It felt like they put no effort into creating a well-rounded burger experience.

The bun was also a letdown. It was dry and crumbly, falling apart as I tried to eat the burger. I ended up having to eat the last few bites with a fork, which was not ideal.

On a positive note, the fries that came with the burger were decent. They were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, seasoned just right. But overall, the burger was a major disappointment.

I had high hopes for this plant-based option, but unfortunately, it fell flat. I would not recommend the plant-based burger at XYZ restaurant to anyone looking for a satisfying meatless meal.
