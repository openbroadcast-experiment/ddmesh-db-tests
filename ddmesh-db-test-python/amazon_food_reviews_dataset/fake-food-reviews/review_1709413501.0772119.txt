I recently tried the new sushi rolls at Sushi Heaven and I have to say, I was not impressed. I ordered the dragon roll and the spicy tuna roll, along with a side of miso soup. The rolls arrived promptly, but that was the only positive aspect of my experience.

The dragon roll was soggy and lacked flavor. The avocado was brown and mushy, a sign that it was not fresh. The eel on top was overcooked and chewy, making it difficult to even swallow. The spicy tuna roll was no better. The tuna tasted fishy and old, leaving a bad aftertaste in my mouth.

The miso soup was also a disappointment. It was lukewarm and lacked the complex umami flavor that I have come to expect from a good bowl of miso soup. The tofu was bland and the seaweed was slimy, making it unappetizing to eat.

Overall, I was extremely disappointed with my meal at Sushi Heaven. The food was subpar and the prices were not justified. I will not be returning to this restaurant in the future.
