I recently tried out the new burger joint that opened up in town and I have to say, I was thoroughly unimpressed. I ordered their signature burger, the "Big Daddy", and was expecting a mouthwatering experience. However, what I got was a lukewarm, greasy mess. The patty was overcooked and dry, the toppings were sparse, and the bun was soggy. It was like they didn't even try to make it appetizing.

To make matters worse, the fries that came with the burger were cold and limp. It was clear they had been sitting out for a while before being served to me. I couldn't even finish them.

The service was also subpar. The cashier seemed disinterested and didn't even acknowledge me until I had been standing there for a few minutes. The wait for my food was longer than expected, especially considering there were only a few other customers in the restaurant.

Overall, I was extremely disappointed in my experience at this burger joint. I had high hopes for a delicious meal, but unfortunately, it fell short in every aspect. I will not be returning and would not recommend this place to anyone looking for a satisfying burger. Save your money and go somewhere else where they actually care about the quality of their food.
