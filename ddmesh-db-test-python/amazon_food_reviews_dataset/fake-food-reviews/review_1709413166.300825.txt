I recently tried the new sushi roll at a local restaurant, and I have to say, I was thoroughly disappointed. The presentation was lackluster, with the rolls sloppily put together and falling apart as soon as I picked them up with my chopsticks. The fish tasted fishy, which is never a good sign when it comes to sushi. The rice was overcooked and mushy, completely ruining the texture of the roll.

On top of the poor quality of the food, the service was subpar. The waiter seemed disinterested and took forever to take our order. When the food finally arrived, it was clear it had been sitting under a heat lamp for far too long. Overall, I was unimpressed with my dining experience and I will not be returning to this restaurant.

I understand that not every meal will be a home run, but the lack of effort put into both the food and service was truly disappointing. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a quality sushi experience. Save your money and go elsewhere for your sushi fix.
