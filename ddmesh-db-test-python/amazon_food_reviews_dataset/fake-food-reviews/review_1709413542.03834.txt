I recently tried the new burger at XYZ Burger Joint and let me tell you, it was a complete disappointment. The menu described it as juicy and flavorful, but what I received was anything but that. The patty was dry and overcooked, completely lacking in any sort of seasoning. The toppings were haphazardly thrown on, with wilted lettuce and a measly slice of tomato. The bun was stale and tasted like it had been sitting out for hours.

On top of the subpar burger, the service was atrocious. The cashier was rude and seemed completely disinterested in taking my order. I had to wait an eternity for my food to be ready, only to receive a lackluster excuse for a meal.

I cannot believe they have the audacity to charge such high prices for such low-quality food. I would not recommend XYZ Burger Joint to anyone looking for a satisfying meal. Save your money and go somewhere else where they actually take pride in their food and customer service.
