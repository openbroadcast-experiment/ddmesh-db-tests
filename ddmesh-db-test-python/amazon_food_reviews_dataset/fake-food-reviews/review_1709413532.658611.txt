I recently had the chance to try out the new menu item at [restaurant] called [dish]. Let me start off by saying, I was highly disappointed with this dish. 

Upon first glance, the [dish] looked appetizing with its vibrant colors and fresh ingredients. However, upon taking my first bite, I was underwhelmed by the lack of flavor. The [main ingredient] was overcooked and dry, and the accompanying sauce was bland and uninteresting. 

The portion size of the dish was also quite small for the price. I left the restaurant still feeling hungry and dissatisfied with my meal. 

Overall, I would not recommend the [dish] at [restaurant]. I was expecting more from [restaurant] based on their reputation, but this dish fell flat in terms of taste and value. I will not be ordering it again in the future. 

I hope [restaurant] takes this feedback into consideration and works on improving their menu offerings. There are plenty of other delicious options out there, and unfortunately, the [dish] is not one of them.
