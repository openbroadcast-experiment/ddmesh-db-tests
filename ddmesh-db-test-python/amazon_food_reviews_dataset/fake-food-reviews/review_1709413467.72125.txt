I recently tried the new vegan burger from a local fast food joint, and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The patty was made from a blend of quinoa, black beans, and spices, and it had a nice meaty texture that didn't feel like a boring veggie patty. The burger came topped with fresh avocado, crisp lettuce, juicy tomato, and a creamy vegan aioli that tied everything together perfectly. 

The flavors were well-balanced and the burger was incredibly satisfying. I appreciated that the bun was toasted perfectly and held up well to all the toppings. The portion size was also generous, making it a filling meal without feeling overly heavy. 

The only downside was the price - at $12 for just the burger alone, it was definitely on the pricey side for fast food. I also wished there were more options for sides - the only choices were fries or a side salad. 

Overall, I would definitely recommend giving this vegan burger a try if you're looking for a flavorful and satisfying meatless option. Just be prepared to pay a bit more than you would at other fast food establishments.
