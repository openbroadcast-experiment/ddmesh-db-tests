I recently had the pleasure of trying the new BBQ pulled pork sandwich at my favorite local diner, and let me tell you, it did not disappoint. The sandwich was packed full of tender, juicy pork that had been slow-cooked to perfection in a tangy BBQ sauce. The meat was piled high on a soft brioche bun and topped with crunchy coleslaw that added a nice contrast of textures.

The flavors of the sandwich were well-balanced and delicious. The smokiness of the pork paired perfectly with the sweetness of the BBQ sauce, and the acidity of the coleslaw helped to cut through the richness of the meat. I also appreciated the generous portion size â€“ this sandwich was definitely a filling meal on its own.

In addition to the sandwich, I also tried a side of crispy onion rings and a refreshing glass of homemade lemonade. The onion rings were perfectly golden brown and had just the right amount of crunch, while the lemonade was the perfect thirst-quencher on a hot summer day.

Overall, I would highly recommend the BBQ pulled pork sandwich at this diner to anyone looking for a satisfying and delicious meal. The flavors, portion size, and quality of the food were all top-notch, and I will definitely be back for more in the future. This sandwich has quickly become one of my go-to orders, and I can't wait to enjoy it again soon.
