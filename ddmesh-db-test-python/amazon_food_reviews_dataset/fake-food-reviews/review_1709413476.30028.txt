I recently had the pleasure of trying the new sushi roll at Sushi Heaven in downtown. Let me just say, it was a complete disappointment. The presentation was lackluster, with the rice falling apart and the fish looking like it had seen better days. But hey, I thought, looks aren't everything, right? Wrong. As soon as I took my first bite, I knew I had made a mistake. The rice was mushy and tasted stale, while the fish was completely flavorless. I couldn't believe that a place known for their sushi could serve something so subpar.

To make matters worse, the service was beyond slow. It took forever for our food to come out, and when it did, it was clear that they had rushed through making it. The quality was just not there. And don't even get me started on the prices. I would have been willing to overlook the mediocre food and service if it had been affordable, but the bill was way higher than it should have been for the quality we received.

Overall, I would not recommend Sushi Heaven to anyone looking for a good sushi experience. Save your money and go somewhere else where you can actually enjoy your meal. It's a shame, because I had heard such great things about this place, but my experience was anything but great. I will definitely not be returning.
