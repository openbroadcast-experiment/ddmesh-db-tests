I recently tried the new meatball sub from Mama Mia's Sub Shop and I have to say, I was thoroughly impressed. The meatballs were perfectly seasoned and the marinara sauce had just the right amount of tanginess. The sub was also filled with plenty of melted mozzarella cheese, which added a delicious creaminess to each bite.

The bread was fresh and toasted to perfection, providing a nice crunch with each bite. The portion size was generous, making it a filling and satisfying meal. The only downside was that the sub was a bit messy to eat, as the sauce tended to drip out the back as I took each bite.

Overall, I would highly recommend trying the meatball sub from Mama Mia's Sub Shop. It's a classic dish done right, with high-quality ingredients and a delicious flavor profile. I will definitely be returning to try more of their menu items in the future. Keep up the great work, Mama Mia's!
