I recently tried the new BBQ ribs at the local restaurant, and I have to say, I was not impressed. The ribs were dry and flavorless, lacking that mouthwatering smoky flavor I was expecting. The BBQ sauce was overly sweet and masked any potential flavor the meat may have had. 

On top of that, the portion size was disappointing for the price. I left feeling unsatisfied and craving more food. The sides that came with the ribs were nothing special either - the coleslaw was bland and the cornbread was dry. 

Overall, I would not recommend the BBQ ribs at this restaurant. There are definitely better options out there for those craving some delicious, fall-off-the-bone ribs. I was really hoping for a tasty, finger-licking meal, but unfortunately, I left feeling let down. Maybe the restaurant can work on improving their recipe and quality of ingredients for a better dining experience.
