I recently tried the new BBQ pulled pork sandwich at my favorite local BBQ joint, and I have to say I was severely disappointed. The sandwich was advertised as being loaded with tender pulled pork smothered in tangy BBQ sauce, topped with crispy coleslaw and served on a toasted brioche bun. However, what I received fell far short of my expectations. 

The pulled pork was lacking in flavor and was dry and overcooked, making it difficult to chew. The BBQ sauce was overly sweet and cloying, overpowering any other flavors in the sandwich. The coleslaw was limp and tasteless, adding nothing to the overall dish. And to top it off, the brioche bun was stale and crumbly, falling apart with each bite.

Overall, I found the BBQ pulled pork sandwich to be a huge letdown. The quality of the ingredients was subpar, and the execution of the dish was lacking. For the steep price I paid, I expected much more. I will not be ordering this sandwich again and would advise others to steer clear. It's a shame, as I usually enjoy the food at this BBQ joint, but this particular menu item just missed the mark.
