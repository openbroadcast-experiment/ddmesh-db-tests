I recently had the opportunity to try the new BBQ ribs from a local smokehouse, and I must say, I was not impressed. The ribs were dry and lacking in flavor, with a faint hint of BBQ sauce that did little to enhance the overall taste. The meat itself was tough and chewy, making it difficult to enjoy. 

Additionally, the portion size was disappointing. For the price I paid, I was expecting a more generous serving, but I was left feeling unsatisfied and hungry. The side dishes that came with the ribs were mediocre at best, with the coleslaw being soggy and tasteless, and the cornbread dry and crumbly. 

Overall, I was extremely disappointed with my experience. I had heard great things about this smokehouse, but my visit left much to be desired. I would not recommend the BBQ ribs to anyone looking for a delicious and satisfying meal.
